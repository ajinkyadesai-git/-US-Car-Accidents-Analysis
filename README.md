# -US-Car-Accidents-Analysis
Conducted an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive dataset comprising 7.7 million U.S. car accident records from 2016 to 2023, as part of the 'US Car Accidents Analysis' project.

This analysis spanned 49 states and focused on categorizing and examining key aspects such as general accident information, weather conditions, road circumstances, and time-related factors. Utilized advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques and libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Scikit-Learn, to derive meaningful insights and patterns. This project demonstrated my ability to handle large-scale data, apply statistical methods, and create insightful visualizations for impactful decision-making in traffic and safety management.Conducted an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive dataset comprising 7.7 million U.S. car accident records from 2016 to 2023, as part of the 'US Car Accidents Analysis' project.
